#Banking System - Comprehensive Documentation
Welcome to the Banking System project! This README provides a detailed overview of the project, including its features, directory structure, Swagger API documentation, and installation instructions.

Project Overview
The Banking System project is a full-fledged solution designed to manage core banking operations, catering to both customers and bank staff. The project encompasses multiple functionalities such as customer management, multi-branch operations, loan processing, transaction tracking, and ATM integration. The system is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, ensuring scalability and performance.

Key Features
1. Customer Portal
Customers can apply for various types of ATM cards and request different checkbooks.
A customer may have multiple ATM cards but is limited to one checkbook at a time.
2. Multi-Branch Operations
The bank can manage multiple branches across different locations.
Each branch can handle multiple customers and accounts, facilitating diverse banking needs.
3. Loan Management
Customers can apply for various types of loans (e.g., personal loans, home loans).
Loan approval is handled by the branch manager.
4. Transaction Logging
The system tracks all customer and branch transactions in real-time, ensuring accurate financial records.
5. ATM Machine Integration
The bank manages ATM machines for customer convenience, providing cash withdrawals, balance inquiries, and more.
Directory Structure
The project is organized into several folders, each handling a specific aspect of the banking system's functionality:

config/: Contains configuration files for the application (e.g., MongooseConfig.js for MongoDB setup).
controller/: Handles the core logic for various entities like accounts, customers, ATM cards, branches, and loans.
Example: Account_Controller.js manages all account-related operations.
db/: Contains database models for the different entities used in the banking system (e.g., Customer.js, Branch.js, Loan.js).
router/: Defines all the API routes for interacting with the backend (e.g., Customer_Router.js, ATM_Card_Router.js).
index.js: The main entry point for the application.
.env: Configuration file for environment variables like MongoDB connection strings.
Swagger API Documentation
Swagger is used to generate API documentation for the Banking System. This allows both developers and stakeholders to understand the API’s endpoints and test them in real time.

Setting Up Swagger
Install Swagger Dependencies: To use Swagger in the project, the following npm packages are required:

bash
Copy code
npm install swagger-ui-express swagger-jsdoc
Swagger Configuration: The Swagger configuration file (swaggerConfig.js) has been added to the project. It defines the API’s structure, title, version, and description. Here is a sample configuration:

javascript
Copy code
const swaggerJsDoc = require('swagger-jsdoc');
const swaggerUi = require('swagger-ui-express');

const swaggerOptions = {
  swaggerDefinition: {
    openapi: '3.0.0',
    info: {
      title: 'Banking System API',
      version: '1.0.0',
      description: 'API Documentation for the Banking System',
      contact: {
        name: 'Support Team',
        email: 'support@bankingsystem.com',
      },
      servers: [{ url: 'http://localhost:3000', description: 'Local server' }],
    },
  },
  apis: ['./router/*.js'],
};

const swaggerDocs = swaggerJsDoc(swaggerOptions);

module.exports = (app) => {
  app.use('/api-docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocs));
};
Integrating Swagger: Add the following lines to your index.js file to serve Swagger docs at /api-docs:

javascript
Copy code
const swaggerConfig = require('./swaggerConfig');
swaggerConfig(app); // Integrates Swagger
Accessing Swagger Documentation: Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI by navigating to:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:3000/api-docs
Benefits of Swagger Documentation
Interactive API Testing: Swagger UI allows users to test API endpoints directly from the documentation.
Automatic Documentation Updates: The documentation stays up to date with the codebase.
Improved Developer Experience: It provides clear details of each route, including request parameters and responses.
Installation & Setup
To set up the project locally, follow the steps below:

Clone the Repository:
